# Graph Algorithms

This is my first project in python during the Master in Data science. The idea beyond this project is to develop a snippet of code to perform a task over a graph.
The graph is a representation of the network of references between many famous mathematical sequences collected in the OEIS Encyclopedia (n.b only a subeset of the
entire encyclopedia is considered).

Given the graph $G = (V,E)$ with 83221 nodes and 483854 vertices the goal is to find sequentially:
* A <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MinimalSet.html">Minimal</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_vertex_set">Feedback Vertex Set</a> (MFVS)
* All the Minimal Feedback Vertex sets
* The minimum Feedback Vertex set
